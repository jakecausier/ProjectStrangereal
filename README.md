# Project Strangereal

A work-in-progress project to present information and history surrounding the Ace Combat universe, utilising a 3D globe to show accurate key locations in the world of Strangereal.

Currently only a simple 3D globe is rendered with a projected map of Strangereal.

The current map data is scanned from [a map created by **Zackary Becker**](https://www.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/czmiqi/finished_strangereal_world_map_for_real_this_time/), based on multiple maps from the Ace Combat series.

[Information regarding the map's projection and scale](https://twitter.com/makanno/status/1169875583154540544) was provided by **Masato Kanno**, lead designer on maps for Ace Combat 5.
